# Exercises

## Exercise one

* Create an HTML web page with the following elements:
    * Head/body sections, along with a title in the head
    * A piece of text displaying the width of the window
    * A red square using a <div> tag and the style attribute
    * A heading of “A cat”
    * An image of a cat
    * Bold text under the cat saying, “This cat is called” followed by a cat name of your choice
    * A hyperlink to some interesting facts about cats

## Exercise two

* Using the webpage from before (with the cat) add the following events:
    * Once the page has finished loading, display some text at the bottom of the page saying, “The cat is ready”
    * Add an input box with the label ‘name’ next to it.  When the input box changes, update the bold text under the cat with the new name.
    * When the mouse hovers over the cat, show some text saying, “Meow!”
    * The “Meow!” text should disappear when the mouse moves away from the cat.
    * If you click the cat, the “Meow!” text should change to “Purr…”
    * If you press ‘d’ on the keyboard, the image should change to a picture of a dog instead.  When showing a dog, it should show “Woof!” and “Bark!” instead of “Meow!” and “Purr…”.

## Exercise three

* Create a website with a piece of text saying, “Hello!” and another piece of text inside a div tag saying, “Click me” which responds to a click
* Make your click handler update the page using document.write(“Goodbye!”)
* Change the click handler to update just the “Hello!” element to “Goodbye!” instead of updating the whole page

## Exercise four

* Create a web page with at least:
    * One element that has an id
    * One element that uses the ```<p>``` tag
    * One element that uses a class called ‘normal’
* Add some css styling which defines two classes ‘normal’ and ‘highlighted’
* Create a button on the page using createElement.  The click handler for it should change all elements with the ‘normal’ class to be ‘highlighted instead.
