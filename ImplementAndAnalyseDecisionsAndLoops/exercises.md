# Exercises

## Exercise one 

* Select two numbers randomly from one to ten.  Display whether the numbers are:
    * Equal
    * Not equal
    * a < b
    * a > b
    * a <= b
    * a >= b

* Investigate how the ‘not’ operator ! works with variables that aren’t boolean, for example:
    * var x = 10;
    * if (!x) {console.log(‘Not X’);}

## Exercise two

* Get the computer to pick a number randomly from 1 to 100.
* Repeatedly ask the user to guess a number, then tell them whether the random number is higher, lower or equal to their guess until they guess correctly.

* Create a menu with the options:
    1. Play 1-100 game
    2. Print Welcome Message
    3. Quit

* Use a switch/case statement to run an appropriate function based on user input

## Exercise three

* Use a for loop to output the numbers 1-10
* If the loop is at number 5, it should continue the loop, skipping the print statement
* If the loop is at number 7, it should break and finish the loop
* Change the loop to be a while loop, and then a do while loop

* Create an object to represent a person with name, favourite colour and date of birth
* Instantiate an array of 3 people, all with different names, favourite colours
* Use for-of to print everyone in the array, using for-in inside the for-of loop to print all the details
