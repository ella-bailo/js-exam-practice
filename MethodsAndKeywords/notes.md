# Methods and Keywords Notes 

## var let and const

### var

* function scoped
* hoisted and initilized, undefined before declaration
* **is** available globally in window object when defined at the top level

### let 

* block scoped
* hoisted but **not** initilized, refferance error before declaration
* is **not** available globally in window object when defined at the top level 

### const

* block scoped
* refferance error before declaration
* cannot have value reassigned
* is **not** available globally in window object when defined at the top level

**Block scope**

Variables declared using the let keyword are block-scoped, which means that they are available only in the block in which they were declared.

**At the top level (outside of a function)**


At the top level, variables declared using let don't create properties on the global object.

```
var globalVariable = 42;
let blockScopedVariable = 43;

console.log(globalVariable); // 42
console.log(blockScopedVariable); // 43

console.log(this.globalVariable); // 42
console.log(this.blockScopedVariable); // undefined

```


**Inside a function**

Inside a function (but outside of a block), let has the same scope as var.

```
(() => {
  var functionScopedVariable = 42;
  let blockScopedVariable = 43;

  console.log(functionScopedVariable); // 42
  console.log(blockScopedVariable); // 43
})();

console.log(functionScopedVariable); // ReferenceError: functionScopedVariable is not defined
console.log(blockScopedVariable); // ReferenceError: blockScopedVariable is not defined

```


**Inside a block**

Variables declared using let inside a block can't be accessed outside that block.

```

{
  var globalVariable = 42;
  let blockScopedVariable = 43;
  console.log(globalVariable); // 42
  console.log(blockScopedVariable); // 43
}

console.log(globalVariable); // 42
console.log(blockScopedVariable); // ReferenceError: blockScopedVariable is not defined

```


**Inside a loop**

Variables declared with let in loops can be referenced only inside that loop.

```

for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  var j = i * 2;
}
console.log(i); // 3
console.log(j); // 4

for (let k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
  let l = k * 2;
}
console.log(typeof k); // undefined
console.log(typeof l); // undefined
// Trying to do console.log(k) or console.log(l) here would throw a ReferenceError.

```


**Loops with closures**

If you use let instead of var in a loop, with each iteration you get a new variable. That means that you can safely use a closure inside a loop.

```

// Logs 3 thrice, not what we meant.
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 0);
}

// Logs 0, 1 and 2, as expected.
for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(j), 0);
}

```


**Temporal dead zone**

Because of the temporal dead zone, variables declared using let can't be accessed before they are declared. Attempting to do so throws an error.

```
console.log(noTDZ); // undefined
var noTDZ = 43;
console.log(hasTDZ); // ReferenceError: hasTDZ is not defined
let hasTDZ = 42;

```


**No re-declaring**

You can't declare the same variable multiple times using let. You also can't declare a variable using let with the same identifier as another variable which was declared using var.

```
var a;
var a; // Works fine.

let b;
let b; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'b' has already been declared

var c;
let c; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'c' has already been declared
```

## Increment/decrement

The below section is directly taken from a [codeburst article](https://codeburst.io/javascript-increment-and-decrement-8c223858d5ed)

### Using ++/-- After the Operand

When you use the increment/decrement operator after the operand, the value will be returned before the operand is increased/decreased.

example:

```

// Increment
let a = 1;
console.log(a++);    // 1
console.log(a);      // 2
// Decrement
let b = 1;
console.log(b--);    // 1
console.log(b);      // 0

```

### Using ++/-- Before the Operand

If youâ€™d rather make the variable increment/decrement before returning, you simply have to use the increment/decrement operator before the operand:

```
// Increment
let a = 1;
console.log(++a);    // 2
console.log(a);      // 2
// Decrement
let b = 1;
console.log(--b);    // 0
console.log(b);      // 0

```
## Addition/subtraction

The below masterpeice is by me 

Operators: + and - 

example: 

```
let one = 1;
let two = 2;

console.log(one + two); // 3
console.log(one - two) // -1

```
